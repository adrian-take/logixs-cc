# Logixs CC Terraform Proyect

## Prerequisites
Before you can run Logixs CC project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html): Install Terraform on your local machine.

## Steps

1. **Clone the Project Repository**
   ```shell
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <project_directory>
   ```

2. **Initialize Terraform**

    Initialize Terraform in the project directory to download required providers and modules.
    ```shell
    terraform init
    ```

3.  **Review Configuration**

    Open the **\`main.tf\`** or relevant configuration files to review the infrastructure setup, resource definitions, and variable values. Make any necessary modifications.

4.  **Set Terraform Variables**

    If your project uses variables, create a **\`terraform.tfvars\`** file or use environment variables to set the required variable values.

5.  **Plan Changes**

    Generate an execution plan to preview the changes Terraform will make to your infrastructure.
    ```shell
    terraform plan
    ```

6.  **Apply Changes**

    Apply the planned changes to create or update the infrastructure.

7.  **Confirm Changes**

    Review the changes proposed by Terraform and type yes to confirm and apply the changes.

8.  **Destroy Infrastructure (Optional)**

    If you want to tear down the infrastructure created by Terraform, use the following command
    ```shell
    terraform destroy
    ```

9.  **Clean Up**

    After destroying the infrastructure, you can clean up any remaining Terraform files and artifacts.


## Additional Tips
* Use version control to track changes in your Terraform configurations.
* Maintain separate environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod) with separate configuration files or variable settings.
* Secure sensitive information, such as API keys or secrets, using Terraform's [sensitive data handling](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables#sensitive-flag) features.
* Consider using Terraform workspaces to manage multiple environments within the same project.
